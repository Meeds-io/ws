 * Created by The eXo Platform SAS.<br/> Abstraction which "encapsulates the
 * activities of accessing resources and transferring resource representations.
 * The connectors present an abstract interface for component communication,
 * enhancing simplicity by providing a clean separation of concerns and hiding
 * the underlying implementation of resources and communication
 * mechanisms".<br/> "REST connectors provide a generic interface for accessing
 * and manipulating the value set of a resource, regardless of how the
 * membership function is defined or the type of software that is handling the
 * request."
